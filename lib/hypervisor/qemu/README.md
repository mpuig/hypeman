# QEMU hypervisor

The `qemu` backend uses `q35` on amd64 and `virt` on arm64. These architecture-native standard boards are selected internally and are not public API options.

QEMU ships many other machine models, including versioned compatibility aliases and hardware-emulation boards that do not fit Hypeman's guest contract. Hypeman intentionally does not mirror that open-ended list in its API. If another model eventually provides a useful, supportable capability profile, expose it as another hypervisor backend with explicit lifecycle and device guarantees rather than as an unchecked machine-type string.

## `qemu-microvm`

The `qemu-microvm` backend uses QEMU's Linux amd64-only `microvm` board. Upstream registers this board only in the x86 system emulator; `qemu-system-aarch64` does not provide an equivalent `microvm` machine. Hypeman uses direct kernel boot, `ttyS0` serial logs, and virtio-mmio transport for disks, networking, vsock, and the optional balloon.

It cannot use PCI/VFIO/vGPU devices or hotplug memory. QEMU limits it to eight virtio-mmio devices; Hypeman counts rootfs, overlay, config disk, attached-volume disks (an overlay volume consumes two), network, vsock, and the optional balloon before starting QEMU.

A `qemu` or `qemu-microvm` standby snapshot or warm fork may restore only with the exact QEMU version that wrote its memory image. Both backends use the single system-installed binary and unversioned machine aliases, so Hypeman cannot relaunch a historical writer or promise cross-version migration compatibility. Hypeman records the running binary's version in `qemu-config.json` and checks it before restore (older standard-QEMU snapshots fall back to the version in instance metadata). If QEMU changes, restore a stopped snapshot with `target_state: Stopped` and start it normally, or recreate the instance; an instance already in `Stopped` state can always cold-start. A stopped snapshot may switch between `qemu`, `qemu-microvm`, and other hypervisors; the target backend determines the internal QEMU board.

## Boot comparison

The opt-in, non-gating Linux/KVM benchmark scripts report p50/p95 `StartedAt` → `ProgramStartedAt` latency and VMM RSS for equivalent nginx guests:

- `./scripts/benchmark-qemu-machine-types.sh [samples]` compares QEMU q35 with QEMU microvm.
- `./scripts/benchmark-microvm-hypervisors.sh [samples]` compares QEMU microvm with Firecracker.
